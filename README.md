# sc-interActive-openSrc-functional programming-Swift
 The third repository to explore functional programming with the fp features in Swift.

 ##### First app 

 A little binary to decimal converter.
 
 ###### Architectural Idea: 
 I think of this program as one single metafunction consisting of algorithmically and hierarchically positioned subfunctions. Each function is a module, a unit in its own right.
 And all together form at runtime one single data manipulation stream.
 

- Data-In

- Function tree

- Data-Out
